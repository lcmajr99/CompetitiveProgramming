# 🧮 Competitive Programming

This repository contains my journey, solutions, and notes from practicing **competitive programming** — including algorithm implementations, problem-solving strategies, and performance analysis.

The goal is to improve **algorithmic thinking**, **efficiency**, and **speed** under contest conditions.

## 📘 Overview

This project is organized to help with:
- Practicing classic algorithmic problems.
- Developing reusable code templates for competitions.
- Analyzing and optimizing solutions for speed and memory.
- Recording strategies and lessons learned from contests.

## 🧠 Marathon / Contest Strategies

Key competitive programming principles:

1. **Classify problems quickly** by difficulty and topic.  
2. **Solve easier problems first** to secure early points.  
3. **Use pre-written templates** to save time on setup.  
4. **Debug efficiently** — understand your typical mistakes.  
5. **Manage time wisely** — know when to move on.  
6. **Collaborate effectively** (for team contests like ICPC).

## 📈 Goals

- Strengthen algorithmic design and optimization skills.  
- Build a reliable library of reusable solutions.  
- Prepare for ICPC-style marathons and online contests.  
- Improve problem analysis, implementation speed, and accuracy.
